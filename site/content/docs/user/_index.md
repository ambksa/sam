Welcome to the User & Operator Guides. This section provides detailed documentation on how to configure, run, and manage Sovereign Agent Mesh (SAM) clusters, control planes, and node configurations.

### In This Section

1. **[Control Plane Configuration](control-plane-configuration/)**
   Learn how to configure the OIDC identity bridge, set up cryptographic private keys, enforce TLS/mTLS, and write custom security role policy mappings.

2. **[Agent Usage & Connectivity](agent-usage/)**
   Understand how nodes connect to the mesh via OIDC login, secure credentials, run local Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and expose secure remote tool access to agents (like Google Gemini and Claude).

3. **[Node Configuration](node-configuration/)**
   Learn how to configure the local node, set up binding addresses, and manage local storage.

4. **[Production Kubernetes Deployment](kubernetes-deployment/)**
   Deploy a production-grade mesh cluster in Kubernetes, including Dex OIDC setups, StatefulSet P2P routers, DNS A-record synchronizers, and Workload Identity ServiceAccount token projections.

5. **[SAM Connect](mobile-app/)**
   Turn your mobile device into a SAM node, exposing sensors and telemetry securely to the mesh, and integrating with native OS assistants.

6. **[A Mesh in 30 Seconds](device-enrollment/)**
   Run `sam-one` on a laptop, scan the QR code with SAM Connect, and call a sensor on the phone from the laptop through the mesh. Two devices behind NAT, no server, domain or identity provider to set up first.
